2022 Paper modeling PEMFCs to understand and address limitations with low Pt loading.

This repository contains the manuscript file, model files, model results, and figure creation files for our paper "Predicted Impacts of Pt and Ionomer Distributions on Low Pt-loading PEMFC Performance," currently in preparation for submission

The `Model` folder contains a "frozen" version of the model code used to generate the results presented herein (the actual code remains in active development, in a separate repository).

The `Results` folder contains the specific model results generated by the model files. These results are accessed by the file `plot_script.py` to create raw png figure images used in the manuscript. These images, in turn, are imported to Inkscape files for editing to create the final versions used in the paper (found in the `figures` folder).
